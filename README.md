# WubbysBongoCrusade

A step in the quest for Elden Ring bongos

## Prerequisites
Download the latest .net core sdk from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-8.0.303-windows-x64-installer

This is just required to run dotnet code, small and quick download and install.

After you have the SDK installed, download either VS code (free) or LINQPad (free, $65 to use with this) depending on the approach you want.

## Contents
### LINQPad (skip if too broke for convenience)
Contains a linqpad script that could just be opened and run. 

LINQPad is basically a scratch pad for .net code. Instead of opening visual studio/vs code, making projects, making classes, etc. you just slap the code in a new tab in linqpad and run. Very convenient if you need to run random code.

To use this script with LINQPad you would want to get the pro version for $65. The pro version has nuget integration, so you can just open the '.linq' script here and everything will run and work. If you really wanted you could probably refund after, or find someone in the community that has some open machine slots on their activation.

### VS Code
A standard c# project. AFTER the dotnet sdk is download, open up the folder (vscode/FindBongoGuid) in VS Code. Hit ctrl+` (~ key) to bring up the console. Then type:

- dotnet build (enter)
- (wait for completion)
- dotnet run (enter)
- (wait for prompt to plug in bongos)
- (enter)
- enjoy success
